    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is Vastrayl?</h3>
        <p>
            Vastrayl is a fashion-first social platform where users showcase their daily outfits,
            rate looks using a transparent 0–10 scale, and participate in themed style contests.
            It’s built for people who see fashion as a form of self-expression.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How is Vastrayl different from Instagram?</h3>
        <p>
            Unlike traditional social media platforms, Vastrayl focuses on fashion discovery
            rather than follower counts or likes. Outfits are rated based on creativity,
            styling, and overall vibe using a fair and visible rating system.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is Vastrayl only for people who want to participate in style contests?</h3>
        <p>
            Not at all. Style contests are completely optional.
            You can upload your daily outfits, explore looks from others,
            and build your personal style profile without entering any contest.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vastrayl works both as a fashion discovery platform and a competitive space —
            you choose how you want to express your style.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What types of style contests are available on Vastrayl?</h3>
        <p>
            Vastrayl hosts a wide variety of themed contests designed for everyone.
            These include office wear, gym outfits, street style, ethnic looks,
            minimal fashion, experimental fits, and many more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether you’re a working professional, a student, a fitness enthusiast,
            or someone who loves experimenting with fashion,
            there’s a contest for every lifestyle and aesthetic.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How does the rating system work?</h3>
        <p>
            Instead of likes, Vastrayl uses a 0–10 rating scale.
            This encourages honest feedback and helps highlight genuinely creative
            and well-styled outfits within the community.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is AI-generated content allowed on Vastrayl?</h3>
        <p>
            Vastrayl is built around authentic fashion and real self-expression.
            To maintain fairness, users can flag content they believe is AI-generated.
            Flagged content may be reviewed to ensure transparency within the community.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the same time, Vastrayl recognizes creativity in all forms.
            Dedicated contests may be hosted specifically for AI-generated or digitally created fashion concepts,
            clearly labeled so users know what they are viewing and rating.
        </p>
        <p>
            This approach allows real-world fashion and creative experimentation
            to coexist while preserving trust and originality on the platform.
        </p>
